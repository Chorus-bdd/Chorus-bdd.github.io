## Running Chorus as a Docker container

This is the easiest way to run Chorus if you have access to Docker.
The Chorus image comes pre-packaged as a Docker image available on Docker Hub.
The image contains a JDK and all Chorus dependencies, making it very easy to run locally or as part of a Docker-based build pipeline

The Chorus interpreter Docker image can be found [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/chorusbdd/chorus-interpreter/)
