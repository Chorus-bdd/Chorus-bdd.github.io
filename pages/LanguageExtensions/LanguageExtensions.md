* [Feature Start and End](/pages/LanguageExtensions/FeatureStartAndEnd) - Add initialization and tear down at feature level
* [Directives](/pages/LanguageExtensions/Directives) - Annotate your feature with technical directives to influence how your tests get run
* [Context Variables](/pages/BuiltInHandlers/ChorusContext/ChorusContext) - Store and access variables within your test steps
* [Scenario Outline Tags](/pages/LanguageExtensions/ScenarioOutlineTags) - Add tags within scenario outline tables
* [Configurations](/pages/LanguageExtensions/Configurations) - Run a feature more than once using different configuration properties
