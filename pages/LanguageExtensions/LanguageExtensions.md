* [Step Macro](/pages/LanguageExtensions/StepMacro) - Group some steps together and reuse them from multiple scenarios
* [Feature Start and End](/pages/LanguageExtensions/FeatureStartAndEnd) - Add initialization and tear down at feature level
* [Scenario Outline Tags](/pages/LanguageExtensions/ScenarioOutlineTags) - Add tags within scenario outline tables
* [Context Variables](/pages/BuiltInHandlers/ChorusContext/ChorusContext) - Store and access variables within your test steps
